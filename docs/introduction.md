# Introduction

TraceNest is a **developer-first, local-first logging SDK** built for modern Python applications.

Its primary goal is to completely remove the operational and cognitive overhead of log management, allowing developers to focus entirely on building features and business logic.

---

## What TraceNest Is

TraceNest is a logging infrastructure layer that lives inside your application.

It is responsible for:

- Creating and managing log files
- Enforcing strict retention and size limits
- Structuring logs in a readable and searchable format
- Providing a built-in user interface to view logs
- Integrating seamlessly with FastAPI
- Operating safely in production environments

TraceNest works automatically and requires minimal to zero configuration.

---

## What TraceNest Is Not

TraceNest is intentionally focused and does not attempt to replace full observability platforms.

It is **not**:

- A log aggregation service
- A metrics or APM tool
- A cloud-dependent solution
- A replacement for business analytics
- A system that sends logs externally by default

TraceNest remains local, transparent, and predictable.

## Core Philosophy

TraceNest is built on three core principles:

1. **Zero Friction**  
   Developers should not need to learn or configure complex logging systems.

2. **Local Transparency**  
   Logs must be visible, accessible, and understandable directly from the project.

3. **Production Safety**  
   Logging must never crash or block the application.

These principles guide every design decision.

## Developer Experience First

TraceNest is designed so that:

- Installation takes seconds
- Logging requires a single import
- Logs appear immediately in the project
- No configuration files are required by default
- The system behaves predictably in all environments

This ensures fast adoption and long-term usability.

---

## Local-First Logging

All logs generated by TraceNest are stored locally inside the project root under:

```text
TraceNestLogs/
```

This ensures:

- No external dependency
- Full control over data
- Easy debugging during development
- Predictable storage behavior in production

---

## Built for Modern Python

TraceNest is designed for:

- Python backend services
- FastAPI applications
- Microservices architectures
- Containerized deployments
- Long-running production services

It works consistently across development, staging, and production environments.

---

## Safety by Design

TraceNest guarantees:

- Non-blocking logging operations
- Graceful handling of failures
- Automatic fallback behavior
- Strict disk usage limits
- No impact on application stability

Logging should never be a point of failure.

---

## Long-Term Vision

TraceNest aims to become a trusted, drop-in logging foundation for Python projects.

By focusing on simplicity, transparency, and safety, TraceNest provides a reliable logging experience that scales with your application without increasing complexity.
